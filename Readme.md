We've created "Eclipsify," a mobile app revolutionizing science education. It demystifies solar and lunar eclipses using simulations, gamification, and debunking myths. With location-based tracking and immersive 3D visuals, 
users can explore eclipses anytime, anywhere. Tailored modules suit all ages, fostering scientific curiosity. Our aim is to boost global scientific literacy and inspire a lifelong love for astronomy. Key features include eclipse details, 
myth-busting, engaging content, user-friendly interface, and a cosmic adventure for all. Join us in discovering the marvel of eclipses!

What it does:

Educates users of all ages about the science of eclipses through interactive educational content
Tracks and notifies users about upcoming visible solar and lunar eclipses based on their location
Simulates the experience of eclipses through 3D simulations from any location
Covers eclipses on other planets like Mars and Jupiter
Busts common myths and misconceptions around eclipses

How it works:

Uses open data from NASA and other sources to determine upcoming eclipses
Leverages the device's location services to 
provide location-based eclipse notifications
Features 3D simulations for realistic and immersive viewing experiences
Educational content like comics and explanations are curated using tools like Figma and Canva

Benefits:

Makes comprehensive eclipse information accessible on mobile for the first time
Allows users to experience and learn about eclipses anywhere via interactive simulations
Separate kid-friendly section cultivates early interest in space through games and visuals
Myths vs Reality section clears up common misconceptions
Inspires space enthusiasts with detailed tracking of celestial events

Goals:

Educate the public about eclipse science in an engaging, easy-to-understand manner
Spark excitement for observing the sky and an interest in space/astronomy
Serve as an ongoing educational resource for better understanding our solar system
Potentially inspire some users to pursue related fields through early exposure

Tools used:

Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the native Android app codebase
Figma, Canva, Resources from NASA for 3D graphics and simulations
Figma for wireframing and UI/UX design
Canva for creating educational comics and visuals
Open data APIs for live eclipse event information
